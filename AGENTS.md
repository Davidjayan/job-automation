## High-Impact Application Strategy

### Core Philosophy
**"Secure the Job."** Generic applications are unacceptable. Every message must be designed to **impress** the recruiter/hiring manager by showing:
1.  **Deep alignment:** You didn't just read the title; you read the *problems* they are solving.
2.  **Opinionated Engineering:** You have a perspective on their stack/domain (e.g., "I don't just use LLMs; I evaluate them using X method").
3.  **Proof of Value:** Connect their specific requirements to your specific wins (e.g., "You need microservices; I built IntoAEC with 11 services").

### ❌ What is FORBIDDEN
- Generic "Hi, I am interested..." messages.
- Listing skills without context (buzzword soup).
- Asking for the job without offering value first.
- Short, low-effort notes like "Here is my resume."

### ✅ The Standard (See "Gold Standard Example" below)
Your message must answer:
- *Why this specific role?* (The hook)
- *Why you?* (The evidence, specific to their stack/problems)
- *How do you think?* (Show engineering maturity)

---

## Personalized Messaging Instructions

**Step 1: Deep JD Analysis**
Before writing, identify:
- **The "Resonation Point":** What specific sentence in the JD sounds like you? (e.g., "Treating AI as part of the system, not just an API call").
- **The Pain Point:** What are they struggling with? (Scaling? reliability? AI accuracy?).
- **The Tech nuance:** Do they use specific tools (e.g., GraphQL, AWS Lambda, Vector DBs)?

**Step 2: Draft the Message**
Use the **Gold Standard Example** (bottom of this file) as your ONLY guide.
- **Opening:** specific hook about the JD.
- **Body:** Story-driven evidence. Connect "I built X" to "You need Y".
- **Opinion:** Mention how you handle trade-offs (Cost vs. Accuracy, Speed vs. Scale).
- **Closing:** Confident, professional, open to discussion.

---

## Salary & Negotiation Strategy

- Initial ask: **₹14 LPA**
- Phrase as: “Based on role scope and responsibilities”
- Avoid disclosing current CTC unless required
- Prefer discussing compensation after initial technical discussion

---

## Automation Usage Notes

When using automation to apply:
- Personalize company name & role
- Select template based on role type
- Attach resume (latest version)
- Track responses & follow-ups

---

## Final Note

This profile is optimized for **high-ownership, product-focused roles** at startups and modern tech companies targeting **₹14 LPA+** compensation. Focus on **quality applications**, not volume.

**Subject:** Application for [Specific Role Name] - David Jayan

Hi [Hiring Team / Name],

I’m excited to apply for the Core AI Backend Engineer – LLM Fine-Tuning role. This description genuinely resonated with me — especially the idea of treating AI as part of the system, not just an API call.

I come from a strong backend engineering background, primarily working with Node.js/TypeScript, building and scaling production systems on AWS, designing APIs, data models, and services that need to hold up under real usage. Alongside that, over the last phase of my work I’ve been spending a lot of time building AI-native products, where model behavior directly impacts user experience.

In projects like GenzForm and LetLMS, I work deeply with LLMs beyond simple integrations — analyzing real production prompts, comparing model outputs, and iterating toward better domain-aligned responses. When new models are released, I don’t switch blindly. I usually run controlled experiments by replaying real user prompts across multiple models, scoring and ranking responses, and selecting models based on accuracy, latency, and cost tradeoffs, not hype. This approach has helped me make practical decisions about which models belong behind which workflows.

While my day-to-day backend work is primarily in Node.js, I have basic proficiency in Python (around 4/10) which I use where it makes sense for AI workflows, experimentation, and evaluation. I am not looking for Python-native core roles, but I can navigate the language for AI-related tasks. I care a lot about inference cost, response quality, and system reliability, because these decisions directly affect product viability at scale.

What excites me about this role is the expectation to own both sides — building scalable backend systems and adapting LLMs to fit a real domain. That’s exactly where I enjoy working: sitting with a vague requirement, designing the system, shipping something usable quickly, and then iterating until the intelligence actually feels right.

I’d love to share examples of systems I’ve built, how I evaluate models in practice, and discuss how I think about combining backend architecture with applied LLM work. Looking forward to seeing if this could be a strong fit on both sides.

Best regards,
David Jayan
